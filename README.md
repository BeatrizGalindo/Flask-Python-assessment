This is a web application built using Python and Flask as a framework. 

## What is the application about?

The application that I develop itâ€™s a very simplified version of an e-commerce website.

## Installation

Use the package manager pip:
```bash
pip install flask
```
Install the database:
```bash
pip install flask-sqlalchemy
```
Install also email validation for flask:
```bash
pip install email_validator
```
```bash
pip install Flask-Seeder
```


## Getting started, first run the command to populate the seed into the app and then run the app.

```bash
flask seed run
```

```bash
flask run
```
